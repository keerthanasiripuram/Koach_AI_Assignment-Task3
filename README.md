In this task, I have developed a multiplayer game using BabylonJS and Earcut, allowing users to create 2D shapes, extrude them into 3D objects with a fixed height, and move them within a shared space. Key features include:

Shape Creation: Users can draw 2D shapes (polygons and circles) on a ground plane.
3D Extrusion: The drawn 2D shapes are extruded into 3D objects, enabling a visually rich experience.
Movement: Players can move their 3D objects across the shared environment, with real-time updates visible to all connected users.
Real-time Collaboration: Changes made by one player are reflected to all users in real-time, enhancing the collaborative aspect of the game.
The game uses Earcut for triangulating the 2D shapes to create the corresponding 3D geometries effectively.
